# SpringRest_Server_Client

This project implements the REST architectural approach using Spring Rest.

We have a Server that works with a database of Employees.

There is also a small Client that sends requests to the server and receives an HTTP response.

Using jackson-databind, Employee objects are converted to JSON format and vice versa.
