# JavaEdu
ðŸ‘€ðŸ§  My projects for learning Java.

The projects are divided into categories. <br>
Each project contains a README description of what is being studied in it.

## UPDATE

This is my pet project that implements a REST API for proxying requests to an external resource. [Spring REST, Spring Boot, Maven, Docker, PostgreSQL, Hibernate]
