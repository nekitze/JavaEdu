# Annotations

There are implementation of HtmlProcessor class (derived fromAbstractProcessor) that processes classes with special @HtmlForm and @Htmlnput annotations and generates HTML form code inside the target/classes folder after executing ```mvn clean compile``` command. 
Let's assume we have UserForm class:

``` Java
@HtmlForm(fileName = “user_form.html”, action = “/users”, method = “post”)
public class UserForm {
	@HtmlInput(type = “text”, name = “first_name”, placeholder = “Enter First Name”)
	private String firstName;

	@HtmlInput(type = “text”, name = “last_name”, placeholder = “Enter Last Name”)
	private String lastName;
	
	@HtmlInput(type = “password”, name = “password”, placeholder = “Enter Password”)
	private String password;
}
```
Then, it shall be used as a base to generate "user_form.html" file with the following contents:
```
<form action = "/users" method = "post">
	<input type = "text" name = "first_name" placeholder = "Enter First Name">
	<input type = "text" name = "last_name" placeholder = "Enter Last Name">
	<input type = "password" name = "password" placeholder = "Enter Password">
	<input type = "submit" value = "Send">
</form>
```
