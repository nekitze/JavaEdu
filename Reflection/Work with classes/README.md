# Work with classes

There are two classes are implemented in this project, but without getters and setters. 
With the help of Reflection, we will create instances of these classes, as well as call methods from them and change the values of fields.

The implemented application operate as follows:

- Provide information about a class in classes package.
- Enable a user to create objects of a specified class with specific field values.
- Display information about the created class object.
- Call class methods.

Example of program operation:
```
Classes:
  - User
  - Car
---------------------
Enter class name:
-> User
---------------------
fields:
	String firstName
	String lastName
	int height
methods:
	int grow(int)
---------------------
Letâ€™s create an object.
firstName:
-> UserName
lastName:
-> UserSurname
height:
-> 185
Object created: User[firstName='UserName', lastName='UserSurname', height=185]
---------------------
Enter name of the field for changing:
-> firstName
Enter String value:
-> Name
Object updated: User[firstName='Name', lastName='UserSurname', height=185]
---------------------
Enter name of the method for call:
-> grow(int)
Enter int value:
-> 10
Method returned:
195
```
