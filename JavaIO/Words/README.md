# WORDS

Application that determine the level of similarity between texts.
The simplest and most obvious method to do this is to analyze the frequency of occurrence of the same words.

Application accepts two files as an input (both files are passed as command-line arguments) and displays their similarity comparison outcome (cosine measure).
Example of program operation:

```
$ java Program inputA.txt inputB.txt
Similarity = 0.55
```
