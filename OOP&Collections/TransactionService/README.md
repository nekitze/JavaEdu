# TransactionService

This project was written to explore OOP and Collections in Java. The project implements LinkedList and Array List, and uses the basic approaches of object-oriented programming.

The application support two launch modes—production (standard mode) and dev (where transfer information for a specific user can be removed by user ID, and a function that checks the validity of all transfers can be run).

If an exception is thrown, a message containing information about the error shall appear, and user shall be provided an ability to enter valid data.

The application operation scenario is as follows (the program must carefully follow this output example):
```
$ java Program --profile=dev

1. Add a user
2. View user balances
3. Perform a transfer
4. View all transactions for a specific user
5. DEV – remove a transfer by ID
6. DEV – check transfer validity
7. Finish execution

Check results:
Mike(id = 2) has an unacknowledged transfer id = 1fc852e7-914f-4bfd-913d-0313aab1ed99 from John(id = 1) for 150
